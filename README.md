# Home Assistant Local Calendar

This repo is a Local Calendar custom component for a Home Assistant.

The calendar is implemented using an rfc5545 python library, aiming to
be compatible with nearly all relevant features for a modern home local
calendar.  See [ical](https://github.com/allenporter/ical) for details
on the underlying python library.
